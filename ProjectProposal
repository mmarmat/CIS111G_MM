I think i may want to make my final projectas a python game, game design is one of the facets of computer science that interests me the most and I believe I can still find something new to learn with python, primarily simple AI, i want to make a game in python that uses a simple AI opponent to go against,  in order to have actual challenge when playing. I also believe that since this will be my first time trying to code utilizing AI in any way, It will be a fun new experience.

So far I have ideas of having multiple games, with atleast one using an AI opponent, hopefully I can figure out a way to make an AI for each game, but I don't want to make it too hard for myself, so I may only have one or a few games with AI, and I can include other games that dont use it for variety. Something I am interested in including is something with random generation utilized in a game, like minesweeper.

Deliverables: The game and its files, a quick document summarizing my game and how to play.
Resources: I plan to record any resources I end up using, I expect to get most of my information via the internet, so links will be included for everything. I also already have basic skills in python GUI and graphics, which may help the quality of whatever I design.
