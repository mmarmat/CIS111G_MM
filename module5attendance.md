The application I have chosen to write about is spotify. Spotify (the company) was founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon in 2006, it launched in 2008. Spotify is a streaming service, the application itself is for audio playback of a database of numerous songs and podcasts. Due to its streaming service nature, you cannot listen to music with spotify without an internet connection, unless you have downloaded the songs ahead of time. Spotify is the most popular music streaming service in the world currently. Spotify runs on majority of platforms, with most of its focus being on the individuals, providing a highly tailored experience with personalized reccomendations based on numerous factors.
I like to listen to music almost 24/7, and my app of choice is spotify. I scarcely run into issues with the service, it is frequently updated to prevent any issues from occurring. The only complaints I have heard about the service are from people who use it without a premium membership. Without a premium membership you cannot choose the order of your songs, download music or skip songs freely. I would reccommend spotify to anybody who enjoys music, but only if they are either willing to pay for spotify premium, or don't mind the limited features a free membership comes with. 
Spotify will need you to make an account with your email and a password you choose. You can use it with their browser application at https://open.spotify.com or you can download spotify here: https://www.spotify.com/us/download/
